Refining Models (Project Part 2/3)

# Problem

Continue from Milestone 1 to build a Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVC model and compare performance.

# Abstract:

The capstone project focuses on diaper manufacturing quality. Generally, to ensure or predict quality, a diaper manufacturer need s to monitor every step of the manufacturing process with sensors such as heat sensors, glue sensors, glue level, etc.
For this capstone project, we will use the SECOM manufacturing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Summary from Milestone 01


### Data Formatting
- **Merging Data**
- **Missing Data**
- **Repeated Values (Columns with the same value)**


### Feature Selection


### ML Analysis
- **Split Data and Class Imbalance**
    - Split Data
    - Class Imbalance
- **Hyperparameter Selection**
    - Hyperparameter Settings for the `Decision Tree` Model
    - Hyperparameter Settings for the `Random Forest` Model
    - Hyperparameter Settings for the `SVC` Model
- **Performance Comparison**


### Summary of Models Performance
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **SVC**
